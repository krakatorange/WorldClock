To use this web application; download this repo, unzip it, and launch the "index.html" file in a browser.

Once you're on the home page; enter the number of cities into the text box, and click submit. Then click on "Show Data" to view the city data. You can also click on "Show Markers" so the info windows don't cluster the entire screen. You can click on the markers to show/hide the info windows one at a time as well.
